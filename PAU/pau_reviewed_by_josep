Look for the repository of the partner you have been assigned to.

First, understand the workflow he/she built in their improved version of their code.

Defining all the functions and latter run a simple condition to call a main function that handles all the other functions


Draw / write the workflow for yourself and note your doubts about it.

 - Ask to play for playing (loop) N - to quit at the end of each game
 - Enter to a main function
 -


Look for things he/she made that you think could be useful for you.

 -


Now go to the first version of the code and compare it with the new version. Do you think the improvement is significant?




Is the git flow useful? Does it clarify some doubts you had?

 -


Try the game. Do you find something that could be improved? Does something surpises you? Set some glows and grows for your partner!

 - Instead of working with conditions, work with a dictonary with the possible convinations
